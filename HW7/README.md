This is the file for my HW7 submission.

I worked on this alone for the most part.

Here we went over the capability of some NLP methods and packages and understood how to use nltk and VaderSentiment in a few of our commands.

Developing a few figures displaying word frequencies and positive and negative connotations to some of our reviewers' statements.

I'm not entirely confident in my utilization of sentiment_vader but I feel like it does what I wanted it to do despite the interesting results...
