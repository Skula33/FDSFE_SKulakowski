Quick overview of HW2:

I did this alone.

Part 1:

We reinforced our initial EDA phase once again with the movies dataset. Introducing the 'tail' call to see the end observations of our dataset, being the opposite to that of our previous 'head' call.

We went into some data cleaning, gathering visualizations and column analysis for missing values. With the introduction of the missingno package we developed viz for missing values.

Once again we did some data wrangling, finding the most and least popular movies, movies that were the longest, pulled the highest revenue and developed a new column to find the movie that made the most money per min of runtime.

A lot of this was review for me, but I did enjoy developing new viz for missing values.

Part 2:

Looking at a new dataset of countries and their happiness ratings and other quantitative metrics. Further reinforcing our basic EDA calls initially and once again going into some data cleaning.

Using the msno package I wend and decided to use the barplot visualization to find the numeric represenatation of missing values alongside the viz of how many points are missing within each column.

Doing some data wrangling and for loops I found the most happy country alongside the highest quantitative measure of each column.

I saw that the United States is not represented within the top 10 happiest countries. Further developing some more pylab viz to find the correlations between Happiness score and other metrics. I go into further depth of each relation on the HW file.

Ending with a representation of the most generous regions of the world. I think I might see myself moving to Sub-Saharan Africa or Western Europe sometime soon...
