Sorry for my late update...

For my Homework 1 I went over some basic commands in pandas and pylab. I worked on this myself, as I usually do. 

I never actually used pylab before so I thought it was interesting to get my feet wet with the correlation matrix command that we went over in class. 

I went over some basic EDA calls with head, shape and describe. We went over our columns call to gather an understanding for the construction and display of our dataframe. I further developed a correlation matrix with pylab and added some personal touches to get quantitative representations of our relationships. Further explaining our data, we went over some basic indexing to metrics to find the youtube videos with the most number of views and likes (pandas). 

I also delved into our 'groupby' call to find the channels with the most number of likes. 

I was most excited to get my feet wet with pylab, I haven't used that package quite yet and am interested to see what else the package has to offer...
