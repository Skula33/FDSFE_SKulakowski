This is my submission for HW6.

I worked on this alone.

I will say that I haven't dabbled in decision trees as much as I should have been doing. I was unsure on a key rule in regards to developing decision trees...

Do you have to make sure that the number of nodes deep your tree is equal to or lesser than the number of features in your model??

Thank you, And I hope you enjoy the visualizations that may or may not be useful or relevant at all.
