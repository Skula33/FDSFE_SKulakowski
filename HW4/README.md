So here on HW4 we essentially went over a log-linear relationship between population and walking speed from 2007 in Bettencourt.

I worked on this alone for the most part and developed multiple linear models using a multitude of packages including numpy, scikit learn and statsmodels.

Interestingly enough, even though I am a statistics major I have never developed a regressional model using the package statsmodels. I felt like the summary analysis of our models gave a multitude of statistics that are very beneficial to understand and will likely be runnnig most of my regressional analysis co-joined between sci-kit and statsmodels.

We compared the complexity of 2 models (linear and quadratic) for fitting this data and saw a lot of interesting things.

While a quadratic model here may in theory 'explain the variance' better than that of our linear model we see that the complexity of a quadratic model is not what we are looking for by our likelihood ratio test.

SIMPLICITY IS ALWAYS KING.
