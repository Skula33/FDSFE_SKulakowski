Sorry I forgot to update the README...

I did this assignment alone.

So this homework assignment essentially went over the basics of hypothesis testing. As an ameteur statistician I felt like a lot of the foundations of this test were review. With some data cleaning and data wrangling we developed some visualizations to gather an understanding of the quanitity of trips by trip duration.

Partitioning our data by gender, we saw that women on average have a longer trip duration, but men have a higher quantity of total trips than that of women. Running some t-tests and ks-tests to analyze whether or not the distributions of these two datasets.

I thought the KS test was a very interesting test to add into my 'datascientist toolbelt.' This is the first time I've used this to analyze the differences of two distributions and will definitely seek to build off of this further...
